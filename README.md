👋 Hi, this is a repo by Anupam Singh.
I’m a 20-year-old founder and research-oriented technologist exploring how complex systems make decisions — and how those decisions fail.

I’m deeply interested in building intelligent systems that operate under uncertainty and scale across real-world domains.

🧠 What I work on & care about:

🤖 Artificial Intelligence — decision intelligence, human-in-the-loop systems

📊 Finance & Markets — risk, regimes, personal CFO systems

🧩 Complex Systems — emergence, simulations, multi-agent dynamics

🧠 Systems Design — operating systems, large-scale architectures

⚛️ Physics-Inspired Computing — information, entropy, computation

🏛️ Tech × Governance — policy-aware, scalable civic systems

I focus on research-grade thinking, not demos —
building systems meant to survive ambiguity, scale responsibly, and matter in the real world.

 🧠 Core themes: uncertainty → structure · systems > models · decisions > predictions · scale > polish
