Building decision-centric intelligence systems for the real world.

About Me

I’m a 20-year-old founder and independent researcher working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, complex systems, and decision theory.

My core obsession is simple but hard:

Why do intelligent systems — markets, cities, institutions, or AI — fail despite having data, and how do we design decision architectures that remain safe, interpretable, and robust under uncertainty?

I build systems, not demos — research-grade prototypes that prioritize correctness, limits, and long-term responsibility over short-term performance.

What I’m Working On
🧠 AIDE — Decision Intelligence Layer

A human-in-the-loop decision intelligence system that evaluates high-stakes decisions under uncertainty.

Focuses on decision safety, not prediction or automation

Models escalation risk, second-order effects, and regime shifts

Finance is the first application domain; architecture is domain-agnostic

🏙️ Urban Decision Systems

Research into why cities fail due to decision bottlenecks, timing conflicts, and incentive misalignment — not lack of data or infrastructure.

⚙️ Systems & Infrastructure

Exploring foundational computing layers:

New OS architectures and kernels

Brain-inspired AI systems

Agent-based & Monte Carlo simulations for complex systems

Long-horizon infrastructure thinking

Research Philosophy

Decisions matter more than predictions

Interpretability beats raw accuracy in high-stakes systems

Human responsibility must stay in the loop

Systems should fail gracefully, not catastrophically

Build for decades, not demos

I am intentionally conservative about claims and explicit about limitations.

Current Focus Areas

Decision theory & uncertainty

AI safety & interpretability

Financial system failures

Complex adaptive systems

Long-term infrastructure design

Selected Projects

AIDE (Decision Intelligence Prototype)

Agent-Based + Monte Carlo Simulation of Collective Dynamics

Urban Decision Policy Framework

Finance-first AI systems (research prototypes)

(Details in individual repositories.)

Writing & Research

Final Note

I’m not optimizing for virality, followers, or quick wins.

I’m optimizing for building things that still make sense 10–20 years from now.
